Notes
=====
1) Finished books, and when they were finished
    - Queried books, then for every book, queried latest reading_update





Cannot query from reading_updates because
1) can't filter reading updates by unique book id,
2) assuming huge data, cannot wait for all to load to then filter

Best way? to sort books by latest start date, then arrange by end date
